Instructions - Miles Wu
-----------------------

Prequisites: You must have libpng installed (and the headers). This might be
             available in your system's package manager under libpng or
             lipng-dev or libpng-devel.

1) make
2) ./nbody <1 or 2>  (1: Cold sphere collapse, 2: Galaxy merger)

Image files (out-******.png) will be produced as output, each one corresponding to
the state at one timestep.

If you wish to combine them into a movie you will need FFmpeg (again install via
system's package manager) and run "ffmpeg -i out-%06d.png out.mp4". A standard
H264/MP4 movie will be created then.
